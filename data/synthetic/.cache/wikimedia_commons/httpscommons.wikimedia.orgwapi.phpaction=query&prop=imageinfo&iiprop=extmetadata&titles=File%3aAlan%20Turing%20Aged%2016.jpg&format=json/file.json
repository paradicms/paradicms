But that is not true, it's a photographer named Chaffin from Sherborne, see [https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/local-news/stolen-items-belonging-alan-turing-4686842] (\"Chaffin\" at the lower left of the photo), [https://oldshirburnian.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TURING-Alan-Mathison.pdf] (page 4) and also [[:en:Talk:Alan Turing/Archive 4#May a photo of Christopher Morcom be added?]] with more sources and details. That would be a photographer from Sherborne photo studio ''W. M. Chaffin & Sons''. There were several photographers from that family working in that studio. Eliminating those that died before 1928, we are left with two photographers possibly active in 1928: William Matthew Chaffin Jr (1861-1937), son of the studio's founder also named William Matthew Chaffin, and his son Arthur Reginald Chaffin (1893-1954). I've corroborated the death years of both with Ancestry.\n\nWe don't know for certain which of the two took the photo, William Matthew Junior (aged 67 at the time) or Arthur Reginald (aged 35). The possibility that it was the latter is rather high in my opinion, so per [[COM:PCP]],  there is significant doubt about the freedom of this photograph.\n\nAlso, the US copyright of a 1928 British photograph was restored by the URAA, so the photograph is still protected in the US until the end of 2023.\n\nGiven these circumstances, the files should be deleted. They can be restored in 2025 when both UK and US copyrights should have expired.","source":"commons-desc-page","hidden":""},"Restrictions":{"value":"","source":"commons-desc-page","hidden":""},"License":{"value":"pd","source":"commons-templates","hidden":""}}}]}}}}
